# Practice JavaScript Reduce

A set of ten exercises in JavaScript to practice writing array `reduce` implementations.
Exercises are numbered from 0 to 9 and get progressively harder.
Each exercise is structured as a unit test suite with one or more tests, which must all pass in order to complete the exercise.
You must use `reduce` where indicated in the test stub. There may be further opportunities to use `reduce` more than once inside the main implementation of each solution.

## Instructions

1. Run `npm i` to install the dependencies (just `jest` and an optional library for creating PNG files)
2. Run `npm run test` or `npm start` to run the unit tests. They will all fail to start with.
3. Make 'em pass!

## Disclaimer

This project is intended purely as a means to practice writing `reduce` for various contrived examples. The use of `reduce` may not actually be the best way to solve these problems "in real life"; nor are these exercises intended in any way to demonstrate "best practice" â€“ they are just for fun!
